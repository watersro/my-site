  <h2 class="heading--main"> About me</h2>
    <p class="profile__text hero__text--lead">Hey, I'm Roman Waters, a freelance web developer. I live in Brighton, 
      which is in the south-east of the UK <div class="profile__image-wrapper">

      </div></p> 
    <p>In addition to my passion for web development, 
      I have a background in web security, having explored the world of ethical hacking. 
      This fun perspective enables me to build websites that not only look great but also 
      prioritize the safety and security of both yours and your users' data.
    </p>
    <p>
      I owe my expertise to a diverse range of experiences. A surprising one is my work with young people
      as life coach! Working with a local charity to empower young people has earned me
        <a class="hero__link" target=”_blank” href="https://www.rockinghorse.org.uk/news/rockinghorse-funded-service-wins-national-award/">recognition</a> and
      fulfilment, as well as honing my skills in problem-solving and adaptability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also informed by a degree in business, I bring an analytical and asset based approach to
      web development. This ensures your website is not just great, but also strategically 
      impactful for your success.
