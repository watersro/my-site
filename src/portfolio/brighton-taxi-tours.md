# Case Study: Brighton Taxi Tours

## Client Overview

**Client:** Ian at Brighton Taxi Tours  
**Industry:** Tourism, Local Transport  
**Project Brief:** Create an engaging, responsive website that showcases various taxi tour services, complete with booking functionalities and an intuitive user interface.

## Approach

### Discovery Phase

- **Client Collaboration:** Worked closely with the client to understand their specific requirements for tour booking functionalities and the desired aesthetic for the website. They needed a user-friendly site that highlighted tours and provided a simple contact process for customers.
Design

### Design Phase

- **Visual Design:** Developed a modern, engaging layout, emphasizing Brighton's local charm. Using Tailwind CSS, I ensured a responsive design that worked smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Tour Display Elements:** Designed a carousel for the Tours section, allowing users to easily scroll through the various tour options. We included features like a seamless, looping experience, ensuring users could access all available tours without interruption.

### Development Phase

- **Responsive Layout:** Created a flexible, responsive layout using Tailwind CSS, which adapts across different screen sizes, from mobile to ultra-wide monitors. I included several interactive elements for a more engaging user experience:
  - **Conditional Contact Form:** Built a form that allows users to select between a general inquiry or a booking. When selecting a booking, additional fields like tour type and requested date are revealed, streamlining the contact process.
  - **Custom Menu and Header:** Implemented a sticky navigation bar with a slide-out mobile menu. The menu overlay automatically closes when users click on an anchor link, allowing a seamless navigation experience.

## Outcome

<a style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://brightontaxitours.co.uk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brighton Taxi Tours'</a> website effectively showcases the tour offerings and reflects the local culture of Brighton. With features like the interactive tour carousel, conditional contact form, and responsive navigation, the website enhances the user experience and simplifies the process for potential customers to learn about and book tours.

This project demonstrates how careful design and development choices can create an engaging, user-friendly platform that meets client needs and is ready for future updates and enhancements.
